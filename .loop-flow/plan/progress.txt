## 2026-01-17 | Session 0 (Project Bootstrap)
Task: N/A (Design Session)
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Bootstrapped Loop-Flow project from design discussion in PROTOTYPE repo. Created:
- Project structure at ~/projects/loop-flow
- AGENTS.md with workflow rules
- docs/DESIGN.md with comprehensive architecture
- Initial backlog with 14 tasks across 4 phases
- Copied PROTOTYPE workflow files as reference

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single global SQLite database** (~/.loop-flow/loop-flow.db) for all repos
2. **MCP as primary AI interface** - focused context returns, not file dumps
3. **"Loop" semantics** - explicit start/end for sessions
4. **Learnings as first-class entities** - searchable, tagged, cross-repo
5. **Minimal per-repo footprint** - optional .loopflow marker only
6. **TypeScript + Node.js** - matches target users, official MCP SDK

### Learnings

- **Context economy is the core insight**: Current file-based workflow grows unbounded. MCP server can return exactly what's needed.
- **Multi-repo from day one**: Design for it now, easier than retrofitting.
- **Team sync is valuable but complex**: Pin for future, don't overcomplicate MVP.

### Open Questions (for LF-001)

- How does Claude Code discover/connect to MCP servers?
- stdio vs HTTP transport?
- How to register custom tools?

## 2026-01-17 | Session 0b (Documentation)
Task: N/A (Continuation of bootstrap)
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Completed user-facing documentation for Loop-Flow:

1. **README.md** - User manual with:
   - Quick start for file-based workflow
   - "For Junior Developers" section with learning tips
   - Workflow file examples and formats
   - Task types and communication protocols
   - Migration path to MCP server

2. **SCAFFOLD.md** - Step-by-step setup guide:
   - Folder structure creation
   - Template files (backlog.json, progress.txt, AGENTS.md)
   - Example workflow walkthrough
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

3. **AGENTS.md updates** - Consolidated all rules from both PROTOTYPE files:
   - Philosophy and coding standards (from root AGENTS.md)
   - Session workflow mechanics (from .agents/AGENTS.md)
   - Complete backlog/progress schemas
   - Task prefixes and special types

### Files Created/Updated

- `README.md` (~250 lines) - User manual
- `SCAFFOLD.md` (~350 lines) - Setup instructions
- `AGENTS.md` (~200 lines) - Complete agent rules

### Learnings

- **Two-layer documentation**: README for users (why/what), SCAFFOLD for setup (how), AGENTS.md for AI (rules)
- **Junior-friendly framing**: Explain not just what to do, but why it helps them grow as engineers
- **Migration path matters**: Users need to know their work won't be lost when upgrading to MCP

### Next Session

Ready to start LF-001 (MCP Protocol Research) in the loop-flow folder.

## 2026-01-17 | Session 1 (Domain Model Analysis)
Task: LF-001.5 [DESIGN] Domain Model Analysis
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Socratic design session to analyze and refine Loop-Flow's domain model before implementation. Used the actual file-based workflow experience as input.

**Key outcomes:**

1. **Learning as Zettelkasten** — Learnings are first-class entities forming a knowledge graph, not just log entries. Links between insights are themselves insights.

2. **Leverage Hierarchy** — Not all learnings are equal:
   - `process` (highest) — how to work better
   - `domain` — problem space knowledge  
   - `architecture` — design decisions and rationale
   - `edge_case` — non-obvious behavior
   - `technical` (lower) — useful tricks

3. **Quick Capture vs Deep Synthesis** — Two modes for insights:
   - Quick: snapshot, mark unprocessed, schedule [DISCUSS], return to work
   - Deep: dedicated time for Socratic exploration and linking

4. **Theory Preservation** — Loop-Flow reframed as a "theory preservation system" (Naur). Code is artifact, theory is product.

5. **Created insights.json** — New file for structured, linkable learnings alongside progress.txt

### Files Created/Updated

- `docs/DESIGN.md` — Refined data model, learning types, link relations, MCP API updates
- `.agents/plan/insights.json` — New file with schema and 7 initial insights from this session
- `AGENTS.md` — Added insight capture protocol, [DISCUSS] task type, file locations
- `.agents/plan/backlog.json` — Marked LF-001.5 done, added LF-015 (scaling), LF-016 (quick capture)

### Learnings

See `.agents/plan/insights.json` for structured captures (INS-001 through INS-007).

Key insight: The workflow itself (Socratic discussion → crystallize → implement) is the highest-leverage process improvement. Loop-Flow's design was discovered this way.

### Next Session

Ready for LF-001 (MCP Protocol Research).

## 2026-01-17 | Session 1b (UX Discovery)
Task: LF-001.5 [DISCOVERY] UX Requirements
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Discovery session to extract UX requirements for Loop-Flow. Used rapid Q&A with interactive pickers to cover breadth fast.

**Key outcomes:**

1. **Cold Start UX** — Agent reminds user (not the other way around). Concise summary + interactive picker for next steps.

2. **Session End UX** — Trust by default. Autosave first, then show brief summary with insights captured. User can tweak after, not before. "See you next loop!"

3. **Mid-Task Flows**:
   - Subtasks: size-based judgment (small=do it, medium=ask, large=defer)
   - Insight capture: multiple entry points (prefix, agent notices, explicit command)
   - Blockers: different types get different responses
   - Context lookup: natural questions or explicit search, current project by default

4. **Conversation Modes** — Discovered four modes: Work, Discovery, Discuss, Review. They blend fluidly (agent reads the vibe). No meta-commentary in Work mode (preserve context).

5. **Discovery as distinct mode** — Different from Discuss. Discovery = breadth (extract requirements). Discuss = depth (synthesize insights).

### Files Created/Updated

- `docs/UX-REQUIREMENTS.md` — New file with all UX requirements from this session
- `.agents/plan/insights.json` — Added INS-008 through INS-013
- `AGENTS.md` — Added [DISCOVERY] task type, conversation modes section

### Learnings

See `.agents/plan/insights.json` for structured captures (INS-008 through INS-013).

Key insight: Interactive pickers (TUI questions) are better than prose for choices. One line of context, then picker. Discovery mode itself is a process improvement worth preserving.

### Next Session

Ready for LF-001 (MCP Protocol Research).

## 2026-01-17 | Session 2 (Bootstrap File)
Task: LF-001.6 [IMPL] Self-Contained Bootstrap File
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Created `LOOP-FLOW-BOOTSTRAP.md` — a self-contained file teammates can drop into any repo to scaffold Loop-Flow. Also renamed `.agents/` to `.loop-flow/` across the entire repo for consistency.

**Key outcomes:**

1. **Renamed `.agents/` → `.loop-flow/`** — More descriptive, matches the project name. Updated all references in AGENTS.md, SCAFFOLD.md, README.md, DESIGN.md.

2. **Created comprehensive bootstrap file** (~450 lines) including:
   - Step-by-step agent instructions
   - Full `.loop-flow/AGENTS.md` template with ALL concepts:
     - All task types (`[DESIGN]`, `[IMPL]`, `[SPIKE]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[BUG]`, `[DISCUSS]`, `[DISCOVERY]`)
     - Conversation modes (Work, Discovery, Discuss, Review) with fluid blending
     - Insight capture protocol (quick vs deep, leverage hierarchy)
     - Theory preservation framing (Naur)
     - "Backlog is a menu, not a queue"
     - Anti-patterns including context compaction
   - Templates for backlog.json, progress.txt, insights.json
   - Instructions for updating root AGENTS.md
   - Complete user tutorial

3. **Design decision**: Bootstrap files should optimize for completeness, not brevity. They're used once per project — length doesn't matter, knowledge transfer does.

### Files Created/Updated

- `LOOP-FLOW-BOOTSTRAP.md` — New self-contained bootstrap file (~450 lines)
- `.agents/` → `.loop-flow/` — Renamed folder
- `AGENTS.md` — Updated all `.agents` references to `.loop-flow`
- `SCAFFOLD.md` — Updated all `.agents` references to `.loop-flow`
- `README.md` — Updated all `.agents` references to `.loop-flow`
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — Updated all `.agents` references to `.loop-flow`
- `.loop-flow/plan/insights.json` — Added INS-014
- `.loop-flow/plan/backlog.json` — Added LF-001.6, updated notes

### Learnings

- **INS-014**: Terseness in bootstrap/scaffolding files is a form of pre-emptive context rot. You're compacting knowledge before it even reaches the new project. Bootstrap files are used once per project — length doesn't matter, completeness does.

- **INS-015**: Loop-Flow's secondary goal is fostering learning and growth toward becoming a great software engineer. This contrasts with "vibe coding" where AI does the thinking. AI should amplify human thinking, not replace it. The "developer has the reins" principle isn't just about control — it's about preserving the capacity to think deeply.

### Philosophy Updates

Wove the learning/growth philosophy throughout the docs:
- README.md: New intro emphasizing growth, updated "For Junior Developers" section, expanded Philosophy section
- AGENTS.md: Added "Foster Learning" workflow rule
- LOOP-FLOW-BOOTSTRAP.md: Updated Core Principles, User Tutorial with growth messaging

### How Teammates Use It

1. Download/copy `LOOP-FLOW-BOOTSTRAP.md` to their project
2. Tell AI: "Please scaffold Loop-Flow using LOOP-FLOW-BOOTSTRAP.md"
3. Agent creates everything, explains usage, deletes bootstrap file
4. Ready to start sessions

### Next Session

Ready for LF-001 (MCP Protocol Research).
