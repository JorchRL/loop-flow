# Loop-Flow Development Progress

This file is an append-only log of development sessions **and learnings**.

- **Session log**: What was done, outcomes, blockers
- **Learning journal**: Edge cases, domain knowledge, tricks, non-obvious behaviors

## 2026-01-17 | Session 0 (Project Bootstrap)
Task: N/A (Design Session)
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Bootstrapped Loop-Flow project from design discussion in PROTOTYPE repo. Created:
- Project structure at ~/projects/loop-flow
- AGENTS.md with workflow rules
- docs/DESIGN.md with comprehensive architecture
- Initial backlog with 14 tasks across 4 phases
- Copied PROTOTYPE workflow files as reference

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single global SQLite database** (~/.loop-flow/loop-flow.db) for all repos
2. **MCP as primary AI interface** - focused context returns, not file dumps
3. **"Loop" semantics** - explicit start/end for sessions
4. **Learnings as first-class entities** - searchable, tagged, cross-repo
5. **Minimal per-repo footprint** - optional .loopflow marker only
6. **TypeScript + Node.js** - matches target users, official MCP SDK

### Learnings

- **Context economy is the core insight**: Current file-based workflow grows unbounded. MCP server can return exactly what's needed.
- **Multi-repo from day one**: Design for it now, easier than retrofitting.
- **Team sync is valuable but complex**: Pin for future, don't overcomplicate MVP.

### Open Questions (for LF-001)

- How does Claude Code discover/connect to MCP servers?
- stdio vs HTTP transport?
- How to register custom tools?

## 2026-01-17 | Session 0b (Documentation)
Task: N/A (Continuation of bootstrap)
Outcome: COMPLETE
Manual QA: NOT_REQUIRED

### Summary

Completed user-facing documentation for Loop-Flow:

1. **README.md** - User manual with:
   - Quick start for file-based workflow
   - "For Junior Developers" section with learning tips
   - Workflow file examples and formats
   - Task types and communication protocols
   - Migration path to MCP server

2. **SCAFFOLD.md** - Step-by-step setup guide:
   - Folder structure creation
   - Template files (backlog.json, progress.txt, AGENTS.md)
   - Example workflow walkthrough
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

3. **AGENTS.md updates** - Consolidated all rules from both PROTOTYPE files:
   - Philosophy and coding standards (from root AGENTS.md)
   - Session workflow mechanics (from .agents/AGENTS.md)
   - Complete backlog/progress schemas
   - Task prefixes and special types

### Files Created/Updated

- `README.md` (~250 lines) - User manual
- `SCAFFOLD.md` (~350 lines) - Setup instructions
- `AGENTS.md` (~200 lines) - Complete agent rules

### Learnings

- **Two-layer documentation**: README for users (why/what), SCAFFOLD for setup (how), AGENTS.md for AI (rules)
- **Junior-friendly framing**: Explain not just what to do, but why it helps them grow as engineers
- **Migration path matters**: Users need to know their work won't be lost when upgrading to MCP

### Next Session

Ready to start LF-001 (MCP Protocol Research) in the loop-flow folder.
